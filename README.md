## Usage

The application is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that allows users to manage a list of tasks. The front-end is built using Angular and the back-end is built using Laravel.

## Angular

Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google. Angular is widely used for building complex, single-page web applications, and is known for its modular architecture and powerful features such as data binding, dependency injection, and routing.

### Angular Commands

- `ng new <project-name>`: Creates a new Angular project.
- `ng serve`: Builds and serves the project on a development server.
- `ng build`: Builds the project for production.
- `ng test`: Runs unit tests.
- `ng e2e`: Runs end-to-end tests.

For more information, see the official [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/docs).

## Laravel

Laravel is a PHP-based open-source web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Laravel is known for its simple yet powerful features such as routing, migrations, and authentication, making it easy to build high-quality web applications quickly.

### Laravel Commands

- `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel <project-name>`: Creates a new Laravel project.
- `php artisan serve`: Serves the application on a development server.
- `php artisan migrate`: Runs pending database migrations.
- `php artisan make:model <model-name> -mc`: Creates a new model with a migration and controller.
